# Publication_paper

This repository is dedicated to various publications I may write on topics related to artificial intelligence, including **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and other related fields in data science and machine learning. It will serve as a centralized platform to document, structure, and share my research, experiences, and in-depth analyses. You will find detailed articles on theoretical concepts and practical applications, implementations of advanced models, case studies, and literature reviews. The goal is to provide relevant and accessible content for both beginners and experienced researchers and engineers.
This repository may also include experimental code, interactive notebooks, and additional resources to illustrate the different approaches discussed. All contributions and constructive discussions are welcome to enrich this knowledge base and promote expertise sharing within the AI community. ðŸš€
