# 📄 Dimensionality Reduction in Machine Learning

## 📘 Description
This document provides an in-depth analysis of dimensionality reduction techniques in machine learning. It explores both linear and nonlinear methods such as:

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**
- **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**
- **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**
- **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**

These techniques are applied to various use cases such as credit card fraud detection, image recognition, and natural language processing.
